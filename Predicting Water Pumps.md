#### Predicting Water Pumps Failures

*1. What is the question you hope to answer?*

The question I hope to answer is which water pump in Tanzania would be functional, not functional (need repairs), not functional at all based on features such as construction year, water payments, management team, region, quality of water, public meeting, scheme management,, scheme management type etc.

*2. What data are you planning to use to answer that question?*

I am planning to use the given data to answer these questions. However, I believe I will need to dig deeper to get a more qualitative understanding of the situation. For instance under Scheme management they have something written off like VWC, WUG, Other etc and those codes do not make sense to me. Technically, I may not need to know the value of the codes to find relations between these different categorical variables but, it would be good to put some context around it once I establish or not relations. 
I have checked the community forum as well as data collection Taarifa portal and they haven't been informative as well. I may need to find other means to garnish this data set.

*3. What do you know about the data so far?*

As mentioned above, I am not sure what some values of some categeorical variables mean and I intend to find out.
Overall, the data is providing information on the region, the cost, who built it, the built year, the management team, the funder, the water scheme manager, quality of water, public meetings???, method of getting water, source of water, permit related to that particular water pump. My goal is to start making visualizations of the different functionality stage of the water pump & cross section it by region. I can try to add more layers on top of it too such as construction year etc. I haven't deeply thought of it but as the lesson catches up, this will be most exciting.

*4. Why did you choose this topic?*

This topic is directly appliable in my home country.
One of of the most well-established social business, Proximity Designs back home has different types of water pumps installation going around. After this project, I hope to pitch and do something similar for their water pumps.

In addition, I hope to attend the Urban Science and Informatics program at NYU after my data science masters. This is a good first case to demonstrate that I am interested in Urban related (not directly, really but this is on utilities) issue.
